# Responsive Custom Info Banner

### What is this about?

- create a Custom Info Banner for announcements, so a stakeholder can use that banner at the top of a website
- create most common color schemes (neutral, success, warning, alert, info)
- simple HTML and CSS

### This Repo is based on:

- built from scratch according to delivered design / stakeholder request
- display of all color schemes for visual purposes, in practice, a stakeholder should be able to select the desired color in a single banner
- obviously the "more" button should lead to more information

### How to run this?

- clone project
- `cd` into project
- open `index.html` in your browser of choice (in my case, built in/for Chrome)
